Kissing doesn't need to be planned it was the unexpected moment that we forgot ourselves and involving without our knowledge.

Kissing you was become my favourite action after you fell in love with me.

Even though we both doesn't know how to kiss still our first kiss was the memorable moment.

It's scene is created by while you were talking to me I accidentally looked your lips and that's the moment I lost myself and it leads to the first kiss of our love story.

So Happy Kiss Day to the girl whom I have rights to kiss.`;
