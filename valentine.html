const story = `The first day I met you was in our school. That time I was just seeing the corridor through my class window and after some time you came through the corridor. That was the first sight for me 👀. 

That moment you were carrying your bag like you were not able to carry that much load. Somehow it was too cute 😅. 

From that day onwards I started collecting details about you. I found your Instagram ID and sent a request. Even though you accepted my request, I didn't have confidence to talk with you. 

My day would never be complete without seeing you. Even if you didn’t see me even a single day, that was okay. 

Two years passed like that. We had conversations sometimes, but not too much and not regularly. I longed to talk to you deeply but I was afraid of what you might think. 

One fine day somehow the conversation started. At that time I didn’t know my life would become this much happier because of you 👀. 

Now you are the reason for my smile, my happiness, and my every day. First we started our journey as friends, but I was not able to see you just as a friend. 

I tried to convey my love many times but I was afraid. What if I even lose your friendship? 

Finally one fine day I conveyed my love to you. Before that day I gave many hints that I had fallen in love with you. 

Finally you accepted my love… and you accepted to be my wife one day 👀🫡. 

That moment I was speechless and very excited. For the first time I felt that my efforts were returning back to me in the same way I gave. 

You became very close to my heart. One day definitely you will become my wife 🫡. 

When we got into the relationship, I remembered a quote I once read: 

"IF IT'S MEANT TO BE, DEFINITELY IT WILL COME TO YOU."

Our story perfectly suits this quote 👀. 

I BELIEVE THAT WE WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER 🫂❤️.`;
